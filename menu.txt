This is the Menu on how to use the map editor.
The keys are too many to be listed in the UI so I decided to write it down here

Q: create obstacle
W: create spawn point ( one spawn point will create one enemy )
E: create flame thrower (default direction is north)

X: export the map into XML ( first map will export to map_0, second map_1 and on and on, the number automatically increase )
Z: clear the whole map ( becarefull, no revert at all )

Left click on the blocks to select it.
Hold and drag to move the blocks around.

When a block is selected it is shown in green color.

all changing of size is using unviersal number, its standard.

+: increase width and height of the block
-: decrase width and height of the block
U: increase width of the block
I: decrease width of the block
J: increase height of the block
K: decrease height of the block
P: change the direction of the flame thrower ( it rotates clock wise )

NOTE:
There is no collision detection in the map editor, so when you are making the map, please do NOT overlap blocks.
